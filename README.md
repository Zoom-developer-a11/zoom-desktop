An enormous number of people are staying away from each other as the world tries to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. In this environment, Zoom Meetings (free, with paid plans starting at $14.99 per month per host) has taken hold and become a top choice among video conferencing apps. For people working from home, Zoom is now nearly synonymous with having a meeting. The app works for other kinds of get-togethers, too, from virtual funerals to happy hours. The more people use Zoom, however, the more it's come under scrutiny. During the first half of 2020, security experts, educators, and average users criticized Zoom on several fronts, which we'll elaborate on momentarily. We at PCMag believe users should be not only aware of the criticisms but also informed of the facts before deciding to use Zoom or to continue using it. 

That said, in terms of its features, stability, and reliability, Zoom remains one of the best apps for video calls you'll find. There are plenty of alternatives should Zoom not meet your standards. We've listed some of them below with links to in-depth reviews where available. 

If you use Zoom, we recommend taking a moment to get acquainted with the tool's key features. While Zoom is an Editors' Choice, we have bumped the score down by a half point in light of recent events. For its stability and reliability, however, Zoom still is a go-to app, particularly for business meetings and personal get-togethers. For government and healthcare use, be sure to look closely at Zoom's offerings for those specific sectors and their more stringent security and privacy requirements.


Zoom's 2020 Controversies
With increased use comes increased scrutiny, as well as increased attempts at exploitation. For Zoom, several flaws and gaffes have come to light. The company has been quick to issue clarifications and fixes for most of the problems. In some cases, however, it has failed to offer solutions that many people find acceptable.

First, the company previously said that Zoomt used end-to-end encryption (E2EE). It had to amend that claim, however, to say end-to-end encryption was used only for calls between people using Zoom apps or Zoom Room, provided no one is recording the call (which is an option in the app); but end-to-end encryption is not available for Zoom via other devices, such as dialing into the audio of a Zoom call using a telephone. 

The matter of encryption got more complicated in June. The company announced it would not provide E2EE to free account holders; then after some backlash, the company reverted its decision saying it would encrypt all calls but only if free account holders verify their accounts with a phone number. Moreover, this phone verification system would not go into effect immediately. The controversy has to do with the implication that Zoom would only protect users' conversations from law enforcement if they were paying customers, and then changing its mind, and still not acting in users' best interest by delaying the rollout of E2EE for all and with an additional barrier for non-paying customers.

Second is another matter related to encryption keys. Zoom owns many servers, some of which are located in China. In 2020, the China-based servers had been generating encryption keys that were given to users in other countries, which is considered a security risk. The company addressed the issue and gave a nuanced account of what happened and how the company fixed the problem. Additionally, users can now control which countries their video conferences are routed through.

A third problem was Zoom-bombing, or people hijacking in-progress meetings with inappropriate content. It seems to have occurred mostly when meeting hosts did not know that they had to opt into using certain features to fully protect their calls. Here, Zoom addressed the problem by changing its default settings and making other security features more prominent so people would know to use them.

Lastly, in California and New York, Zoom may face legal challenges after sharing data about user activity with Facebook without the user's consent. As with the other issues mentioned so far, the company was quick to acknowledge the problem and make appropriate changes.

Background on Zoom
Zoom Meetings' story began in 2011 when the market for video conferencing software was crowded. (It still is.) There was no shortage of choice for making video calls. The problem was none of the services held up well. Not a one. Glitchy video, stalling audio, and calls that wouldn't connect left people frustrated. Into this mucked-up space waltzed Zoom Video Communications, a new company focused on making video calls smoother and more reliable.

Flash forward to the era just before COVID-19. San Jose, California-based Zoom was a darling in the tech industry, with a successful initial public offering (IPO) announced in April 2019 to match. Its success largely stemmed from making good on its promise to make video calls better by making them more stable. Even before COVID-19, Zoom was doing extremely well as a company and had a strong reputation.

The company's core product, called Zoom Meetings (typically shortened to just Zoom), impresses for other reasons, too. It has a fantastic feature set that includes, for example, high definition (HD) video and audio and the ability to get typed transcripts of calls that you record as videosâ€”that last one is reserved for paying members only. The app considers the needs of people who join calls only occasionally as well as remote teams who connect daily.

Anyone can use Zoom for free. For small businesses and individuals who want more features, paid plans are reasonably priced starting at $14.99 per month. Enterprise-grade accounts, which cost more, include all the administrator controls you'd expect plus a full voice-over-IP service called Zoom Phone. In the breadth of what it offers, Zoom Meetings is similar to Editors' Choices Cisco Webex Meetings and ClickMeeting, even if the features aren't identical. Still, Zoom's greatest hook remains its stability. Stability is tough to quantify and compare in video conferencing systems, but it's the foundation of Zoom, and it shows.

Getting Started With Zoom Meetings
If you're invited to a meeting in Zoom Meetings, you don't need to create an account. However, you will see a prompt to download the Zoom Meetings application. Downloading the app is optional as you can connect via a web app if you prefer, but the installed app does give you the optimized experience. Zoom Meetings has apps for Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, and macOS.

If you want to use Zoom Meetings to host a meeting and invite others to join, then you need to create an account. You can authenticate with Facebook or Google, or sign up using an email address and password. When you create an account, you get a Personal Meeting ID (PMI), which you can use at any time to start a meeting. It's handy because you can use the same meeting link over and over again, which is handy for small groups that meet regularly. In other words, you never have to generate a fresh link to meet. You always have the option, however, to create a unique meeting ID and link, which may be preferable for security reasons.

To connect to the audio of the call, you and your meeting participants can choose to connect using your computer or mobile device or by dialing in by phone using a standard rate or toll-free number where supported. There's no toll-free number for the US or the UK, although there are for dozens of other countries.

Depending on your settings, participants may be able to join the audio portion of the call via Microsoft Skype for Business. It's also possible to set up a third-party audio system of your choosing and include instructions for dialing in the meeting invitation.

Zoom Meetings' free account is generous. You can host up to 100 people on a call and you can see as many as 49 people at a time in Gallery view mode. All calls are free, but group calls get cut off after 40 minutes. One-on-one calls can be as long as you need.

There's no limit on how many meetings you can host as a free user, and you get all the most important features and tools. A few features you don't get are reports, user management controls, and administrator controls. The free account also does not include any cloud space to store recorded calls, although you can record the video of your calls and store them locally.

The locally installed app and the web account contain slightly different settings, and it's in your best interest to explore both. We highly encourage new users to spend time going through the settings before using Zoom, not only for privacy and security reasons, but also to get the most out of what Zoom has to offer. For example, there are options to put attendees on hold, give remote control of your keyboard and mouse to another person while you give a presentation, touch up your appearance, and automatically adjust your picture in low light.
